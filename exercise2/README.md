### Small coding exercise 2

**Task 2.1** Write a sumForFour function. 
The function takes four numbers as input, and prints one value as output. 
The output should be the sum of the four numbers passed to the function. 
The function should also check for variable types.
If any of the numbers is passed as a string type as opposed to an integer or float type, the function will print an error message.  

 

**Task 2.2** Write a function that asks the user for a number `n` and prints the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n`.
The function should also check for input types. The input is expected be an integer. 
When a float number is provided, run the function for the integer part of the float along with a warning message. 
If the input is of any other type, print an error message.

 

**Task 2.3** Type `import random` in a new code block in your jupyter notebook, and then run `random.random()`.
* What does `random.random()` do here?
* What is `random.random`?
* What do you think the dot symbol `.` is doing here?
* What about the first `import random`? What does that do?
