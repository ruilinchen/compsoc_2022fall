### Small coding exercise 3

**Task 3.1** Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input, finds the largest and smallest element of the list, 
and returns the largest element minus the smallest element as output.

**Task 3.2** Write a function that takes two lists as input, combines them by alternatively taking their elements, 
e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] â†’ [a,1,b,2,c,3], and returns the combined list as output.

**Task 3.3** Write a function that takes a list as input, and returns a frequency table of the list in the format of a dictionary. 
Example: ['a', 'b', 'a'] -> {'a': 2, 'b': 1}

**Task 3.4** Write a function that takes two lists as input, and returns another list that contains only the elements that are common between the two lists (without duplicates). 
Hint: Use `set` for this task.
