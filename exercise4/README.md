### Small coding exercise 4

**Task 4.1** Read the file "example.txt" that we have used in class, 
which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.online-convert.com/file-format/txt), 
and print out every other line starting from the seventh line.

**Task 4.2** Write a sumForTwenty function. 
The function takes twenty numbers as input (not as user input, but as function arguments), 
and prints one value as output. 
The output should be the sum of the twenty numbers passed to the function. 
The function should also check for variable types. 
If any of the numbers is passed as a string type as opposed to an integer or float type, the function will print an error message.  


**Task 4.3** Write a duplicateNames function. 
The function takes a list of string and an integer N as argument, and return another list of string as output. 
The output duplicates the input list N times and updates the string values by adding an incremental number starting from 1 to them. 
Example: list = ['a', 'b'], N=3 -> ['a1', 'b1', 'a2', 'b2', 'a3', 'b3']. 


**Task 4.4** Write a top3Players function. 
The function takes a dictionary as argument. This dictionary keeps track of players and their scores. 
Based on this, the function returns the top 3 players with the highest scores as output. 
Example: {'lebron': 70, 'kobe': 80, 'stephen': 75, 'michael': 85, 'larry': 82} -> 'michael', 'larry', 'kobe'.
