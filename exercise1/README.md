### Small coding exercise 1


Task 1.1 Prepare a jupyter notebook with the following two sections:


Section 1: A brief introduction of yourself in Markdown that talks about:
  * Who you are 
  * What you are studying
  * Why you want to take this course

Use at least two different headings and/or font formats to organize the content. 

Section 2: 
Write a GreetingBot function that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.
It should first print a message, asking the user to provide their name, and then print a greeting message. 
Run your GreetingBot to introduce yourself to “the python world”. 

Section 3: 
Write a GreetingBotForFriends function that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name. If the user’s name is Alice, then greet Alice with “Hey, Alice! It is you!”. 
Otherwise, greet with a more generic welcome message.

Run your GreetingBotForFriends twice to greet Alice and Alex respectively.
