### Small coding exercise 9

**Task 9.1** Use the cleaned crime dataset for Boston, 2019 from previous assignments to create a choropleth map that looks something like [this example](https://crimegrade.org/safest-places-in-boston-ma-metro/) online. 
The map should visualize crime variability at the zip-code level. The geography of Boston’s zip codes can be found [here](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/zip-codes). 
The map should be colored based on the total count of crime incidents in each zip code for the year of 2019. 

 

**Bonus task 1** Download the birth rate by country data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/crude-birth-rate) and the life expectancy by country data [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy?time=1822).
Use these two csv files to recreate the famous animation from [Hans Rosling’s
TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w)
in 2007. 
It is an animated bubble plot (or scatter plot) with X axis being national birth rate and 
Y axis being national life expectancy, and it dynamically shows how these values change over the years. 


**Bonus task 2**: To reproduce the animation exactly, you also need to download the population size data [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) 
and make the size of each bubble dependent upon the country’s population size. 
You can get an extra point if you are able to implement this feature in your animation as well.
